//Executed on Every Render: When setForecastDay is called outside useEffect, it runs immediately during every render phase. This causes the state (forecastDay) to update, triggering a re-render.

//Re-render Feedback Loop: Each re-render triggers the logic again, setting the state again, causing another re-render, and so on indefinitely. This feedback loop leads to an infinite cycle because thereâ€™s no mechanism, like useEffect, to control or defer the state update.

//If you don't pass any dependency array to useEffect, it runs after every render. While this won't break your application, it does lead to unnecessary execution of the code inside useEffect.
